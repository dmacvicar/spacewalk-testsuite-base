Feature: Test Oracle and PostgreSQL databases connections.
  Scenario: I prepare to connect to the Databases
    And I define user "spacewalk" for Oracle DB
    And I define password "spacewalk" for Oracle DB
    And I select the database "susemanager" for Oracle DB
    And I define user "spaceuser" for Postgres
    And I define password "spacepassword" for Postgres
    And I select the database "spaceschema" for Postgres
    Then I should connect and see at least one result back
